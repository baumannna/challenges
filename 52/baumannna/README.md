## **Pomodoro Timer**

This is a Pomodoro Timer application prepared for the Pybites coding challenge #52. I started this challenge as part of my 100 days of Code challenge from TalkPython on day 3.

The Timer will prompt for an amount of minutes. After this time it will alert the User with a beep-sound and asks if the user want to start another iteration or not.
